# Identity Verification Dataset
The dataset comprises **45** people, featuring **1,215** videos and **405 **audios, specifically designed for enhancing video **KYC** and digital **identity verification** processes. It is designed for **verifying customers**, preventing **fraudulent activity**, and mitigating risks associated with identity frauds and deepfakes.

By utilizing this dataset, researchers can develop and benchmark advanced AI models for **verifying identity** and detecting **fraud risks** through multi-modal analysis of **biometric** data from video recordings.  - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/speech-and-emotion-video-dataset-for-kyc-verification/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=kyc-verification-dataset)**

Dataset contains recordings of 45 individuals, each performing 3 different sentences. Every sentence is spoken with 3 distinct emotions and captured from 3 different camera angles
